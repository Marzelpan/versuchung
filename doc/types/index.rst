Experiment Parameters
*********************

The most part of versuchung are classes which can be used either as
input, as output parameters or as both. They are used for defining
strict experiment parameters and determine the experiment
results. They are used in
:attr:`~versuchung.experiment.Experiment.inputs` and
:attr:`~versuchung.experiment.Experiment.outputs` attributes of a
:class:`~versuchung.experiment.Experiment`.
